# operator, what's your beef?

pub/sub plugin on steroids

---

inspired from ben alman's original pub/sub [gist](https://gist.github.com/cowboy/661855), but spawned from rick waldron's [gist](https://gist.github.com/rwaldron/705311).

# Testing
Tests are run using [testem](https://github.com/airportyh/testem).  Please refer to their docs for setting that up.
[Phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) is also a great resource for headless browsers.

To run tests:

    ~/ $ cd operator
    ~/operator $ testem -l phantomjs
